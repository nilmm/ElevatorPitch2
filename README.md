### ElevatorPitch Assigment
Have you ever imagined how hard must be the life of a paralitic person? If you haven't, I'm telling you... It's pretty hard... That's why we are going to help them, so they can walk again. We are going to bring them a new pare of legs (exoskeleton), and those are going to do the work that their muscles can't. With our product, we are willing to give them the freedom that the weelchair prevents.
